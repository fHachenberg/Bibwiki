ABOUT BIBWIKI

Bibwiki is an extension for Mediawiki to create and manage
scientific bibliographies. The bibliographies are stored in 
plain text files in the common BibTeX format. With Bibwiki 
it's easy to:

    * import from Ex Libris Aleph, Amazon, ArXiv,
      Proquest/CSA databases and many more;
    * manage digital documents (PDF files, web pages, etc.);
    * export lists of references via BibTeX; 
    * create lists of references in Mediawiki articles.
